\section{Introduction}
Transaction is a useful programming abstraction for manipulating 
shared data. In transactional programming,  a set of  shared data 
operations that has been enclosed by begin() and end() transaction 
directives get executed as a one atomic unit. The consistency, 
isolation and durability guarantees of the same data also 
get handled by the runtime, executing the transactions. 

Modern databases/data stores manage large amounts of data. 
Servicing data operations using a single node is not feasible 
due to lack of data capacity and compute. Modern large-scale 
datastore deployments solves this by partitioning the 
data store among multiple compute/data nodes.
